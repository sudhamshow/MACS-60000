    "# Week 6 - Prediction & Causal Inference\n",
    "\n",
    "Last week, we explored (supervised) text classification, where we train a model to learn associations between text and some classification or value connected with it (e.g., what distinguishes a winning argument before the Supreme Court; can we extend our judgment regarding what documents are relevant to my thesis project to all of Google News; etc.) Classification often uses a representative sample of text about which we want to make inferences and then we use machine learning to learn \"true\" assignments and classify the rest.\n",
    "\n",
    "This week, we explore two different types of inferences to out-of-sample populations. _Prediction_ involves our reasoned expectation regarding an unobserved state of the world, given the world in which we live and on which we have trained our prediction algorithm. Often this prediction is about the future world. We don't expect the U.S. Congress to talk about the identical things today and tomorrow, but today should contain some useful information. by contrast _causal inference_ poses the related by distinct challenge of our reasoned expectations regarding an unobserved state of the world IF we intervene in some way. In other words, what does the intervention cause, and how can we predict it to change the world. Causality has a deeply contested history in social science and philosophy, but it usually involves an \"if,\" a difference between two counterfactual worlds, one where an event occurs and one where it doesn't.\n",
    "\n",
    "Causal questions in text analysis may place the text in one or more of many positions we explore below: as cause, effect, confounder, mediator (or moderator), or collider. For example, assuming that everything spoken can be transcribed into text, saying something mean might hurt someone's feelings (text as cause). Doing something mean might cause someone to say something angry (text as effect). Apologizing might change the influence of doing something mean (text as mediator/moderator). A compliment might obscure the effect of doing something mean (text as confounder). And yelling something audaciously mean might yield a loud, emotional response, which both influence the likelihood that the interaction was recorded and subjected to analysis (text as collider). As you can see, in a single conversation, text can play all of these roles. Why do we care about cause and effect with text? Because while words appear to exert power in the world, which words spoken under what circumstances by whom? Causal analysis attempts to get at the question, if _X_ was written or spoken, _Y_ would happen."

    "# Prediction\n",
    "We can make predictions about a range of different text 'populations'. We can use texts in English to predict their translations in French. We can use newspaper articles from 2012 to 2022 to forecast the contents of 2023 newspaper articles (e.g., a [time series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series)). Or we can \"nowcast\" by using real-time social information such as Tweets to predict when an important event is happening, such as a riot.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we don't have any information about how the new population will vary from the population we modeled, then prediction is implemented in the same way as in-sample inference. E.g., if you have a categorization of 2022 emails as spam or ham, you could predict whether 2023 emails are spam the same way you predicted 2022 emails. On the other hand, if you have new information, such as a trend beginning in December 2022 for spam emails to have \"Urgent:\" in the subject line, your 2023 prediction may differ by putting more weight on that indicator relative to others.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this way, prediction is similar to the classifications we performed last last week, incorporating multidimensional trends (e.g., time, place, source) learnable from your current corpus. We encourage you to think more about this if you are interested in predicting the future of your corpus!"

    "# Text in causal inference\n",
    "\n",
    "In causal inference, we are interested in the effect of a _treatment_ on an _outcome_. There are five types of variables that could be directly involved in our causal model, and any could be a text variable. This figure from [Keith et al. 2020](https://aclanthology.org/2020.acl-main.474.pdf) concisely shows the five positions for variables in acyclic (i.e., no arrows flow back into themselves) causal inference: treatment, mediator, outcome, confounder, and collider.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UChicago-Computational-Content-Analysis/Homework-Notebooks/main/week-6/img/causal_diagram.png\" alt=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UChicago-Computational-Content-Analysis/Homework-Notebooks/main/week-6/img/causal_diagram.png\" style=\"width:500px\">\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Text as treatment\" means the effect of text on other variables. For example, how does the news coverage of a politician affect their election chance? How does the sentiment of a Reddit post affect its upvotes?\n",
    "\n",
    "Whether we're interested in text as treatment, mediator, outcome, or confounder, we have at our disposal the same causal inference strategies used with other forms of data, such as matching, difference in difference, regression discontinuity, and instrumental variables. Each of these methods usually gives you a more precise conditional identification of the causal influence than regressing an effect on a singular (purported) cause. For example, one of the readings for this week, [Saha 2019](https://doi.org/10.1145/3292522.3326032), uses propensity score matching, which is a straightforward method that works on most datasets (see Professor Gary King on [coarsened exact matching](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvMyjDi4dyg)). For this assignment, we do not detail each of these causal strategies, but note several courses at UChicago that introduce these methods, as well as online textbooks (e.g., Scott Cunningham's [Causal Inference: The Mixtape](https://mixtape.scunning.com/)).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can do causal inference on any sort of text data as long as you have a plausible _identification_ strategy, meaning an argument that you can correctly identify a causal effect if one exists using your data and analysis. For example, if you have a data from a randomized controlled trial (RCT) where you intervene randomly with some treatment, you can identify a causal effect with relative ease. Text exhibits a wide array of dependencies making unconditional randomization impossible, but we will attempt strategies that approach it. "

    "Now we have 1,346 triples of quote-response1-response2, several text variables of response1 (e.g., \"Is the respondent using sarcasm?\") that may predict the agreement of response2. In other words: _Does a sarcastic comment lead to more agreement?_ Of course, as with almost all observational data, there are a number of confounders that make our identification difficult, but for now, let's explore how to run a simple regression in Python of agreement_r2 (dependent variable, commonly known as Y) on sarcasm_r1. Fortunately, we do have a strong case for identifying the direction of causality: Because response1 comes before response2, we can rule out the possibility that response2 affects response1."

With this new regression model, we see a significant effect from attack_r1/nicenasty_r1 and sarcasm_r1, indicating both of these dimensions affect whether the response2 agrees with response1. Note that the coefficients are both positive: For attack_r1/nicenasty_r1, this means that a more \"nasty\" comment led to more disagreement, and for sarcasm_r1, this means that a more sarcasistic comment led to more disagreement.\n",

The length may be particularly important based on how it affects the annotations of Mechanical Turk workers. For example, as we were skimming through the data, it seemed like shorter comments were being rated as more nasty. For sentiment, let's use the convenient BERT pipeline we used last week and which we will detail and theorize in weeks to come."

    "The condition number is reasonably high, but our correlatons do not seem too strong. Overall, our finding of significant effects for attack_r1/nasty_r1 and sarcasm_r1 persists with these new controls! This sort of robustness or sensitivity analysis is important for making sure your finding is compelling to yourself and to your audience. Consider doing other robustness checks, such as standardizing these variables before running the regression or adding [robust standard errors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heteroscedasticity-consistent_standard_errors). (To be clear, the analysis above would likely not be sufficient as proof of a causal effect for a peer-reviewed journal; you would likely need a more conditional approach using matching, instruments or differences in differences.)"

    "<font color=\"red\">Propose a simple causal model in your data, or a different causal model in the annotated Internet Arguments Corpus (e.g., a different treatment, a different outcome), and test it using a linear or logistic regression model. If you are using social media data for your final project, we encourage you to classify or annotate a sample of that data (either compuationally or with human annotators) and examine the effect of texts on replies to that text (e.g., Reddit posts on Reddit comments, Tweets on Twitter replies, YouTube video transcripts on YouTube comments or ratings). You do not need to make a graph of the causal model, but please make it clear (e.g., \"X affects Y, and C affects both X and Y.\").\n",

We will explore this further in Week 8 on Text Generation and Conversation.\n",

    "<font color=\"red\">***Stretch*** (not required): Propose a more robust identification strategy using either matching, difference in difference, regression discontinuity, or an instrumental variable. Each of these methods usually gives you a more precise identification of the causal effect than a unconditional regression.

    "## Splitting training and test text\n",
    "Above, we used a number of external measures of text, meaning that the measures were developed without any influence from this dataset. For annotations, it was Mechanical Turk workers measuring the text. For length, that is a mathematical count of characters. For sentiment, it was from a BERT model not trained on the Internet Arguments Corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is not always the case. Consider if we want to make a measure of the text based on topic modeling. We build an LDA topic model of these comments, then we select an appealingly relevant topic and measure what number of words from Topic 1 each comment uses. Can we put that measure in the regression? We could, but it would lead to a biased estimate of the true effect size because our measure is no longer external or exogenous. The measure and model are double-dipping from the same textual information. This is important to keep in mind for your final projects, and for a more thorough explanation and justification, you can read more about this in [Egami et al. 2018](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.02163.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "One approach to this in the Internet Arguments Corpus would be to build measures with the `pairs` that were not also `triples`. Sometimes we have excess data like this that is similar enough to our regression data, which we can use without reducing our regression sample size. For example, you could abductively generate a keyword-count measure like \"argumentativeness\" or \"thoughtfulness\" from non-triple pairs that isn't already in the annotations, and then count the keywords in the triples. You could develop an LDA model or word embedding measurement on some of the data, and the use it to establish an inferential relationship on the rest of the data. This would avoid contamination."

Instead, it could be another variable that affects both our treatment and outcome, known as a _confounder_. Recall the [Keith et al. 2020](https://aclanthology.org/2020.acl-main.474.pdf) figure showing the role of a confounder.\n",

    "\n",
    "Why do we need to control for confounders? If we didn't, we might correctly find that the treatment and outcome are correlated, but rather than one causing the other, they could both be caused by a third variable. For example, if we are studying the effect of the journal a paper is published in on the citations of the paper, we may be worried that the text of the article affects both whether it is published by the journal and whether people cite it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The factors we controlled for in the Internet Arguments Corpus could be seen as confounders, but there are also specific methods to control for text confounders. As an example, we will walk through the method proposed by [Pryzant et al. (2018)](https://nlp.stanford.edu/pubs/pryzant2018lexicon.pdf).\n",

    "It looks like \"nike\" is associated with higher sales! But that doesn't help me very much because I can't just advertise my shoes as Nikes. That would be incorrect and illegal (false advertising). What if we could build a lexicon of words like \"nike\" associated with certain brands and control for that in my analysis? We could then identify brand-agnostic words like \"fresh\" that have the causal effect of interest. This is the approach by Pryzant et al.\n",

When US residents complain about financial products (e..g, mortgages, credit reports), the CFPB sometimes handles these on a \"timely basis (<15 days)\" and sometimes not. If you want to submit a complaint, how should you word it so you get a timely response? We want to control for the differences in wording that result from different products to identify the causal effect of interest. For example, if saying \"mortgage\" is associated with a timely response, that doesn't mean you should throw \"mortgage\" into your complaint about a credit report.\n",

This suggests that saying `mortgage` is actually a good way to get a timely response even if your complaint isn't about a mortgage! That's interesting. As with other causal inference approaches, we can take a closer look at our data to help explain the results. For example, let's look at whether the `Mortgage` `Product` category had a very high timeliness rate. \n",

You will see padding very frequently in other text-based neural networks and should keep it in mind when building your own in the future."

Similar to Pryzant et al., Veitch et al. have a great [GitHub respository](https://github.com/blei-lab/causal-text-embeddings) with the data and code for their paper, and their dataset of computer science papers, PeerRead, has its own great [repo](https://github.com/allenai/PeerRead).\n",
